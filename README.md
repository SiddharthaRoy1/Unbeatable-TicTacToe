# Unbeatable-TicTacToe
This is a single player tictactoe game which utilises basic artificial intelligence principles.
The code recursively searches for the best possible outcome using the minimax algorithm and plays it, and it is impossible
to beat it as the algorithm has already searched all the possible moves the human can make at a particular point and played it's
move accordingly.
On top of that the algorithm gives the shortest winning route for the computer, if it is possible , and it does not matter wether 
the human is playing a perfect game.
